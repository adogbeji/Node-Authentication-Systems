Important Points:-

1) If building an application with a Front-End (eg React, Vue), then entry point should be 'server.js'
2) But for a complete, backend, server-side rendered application, then entry point should be 'app.js'
3) The 'connect-mongo' package allows us to store our sessions in our database.
   This prevents us from getting logged out when we restart the server!

4) The 'express-session' package is for sessions and cookies
5) 'express-handlebars' will be used as a view engine, but you can use others too (eg. EJS).
   You can even put JSON and use React/Vue etc ??

6) By default, you can only make GET & POST requests from your templates.
   The 'method-override' package will allow us to make PUT & DELETE requests from our templates too!

7) The 'moment' package is used to format dates
8) The 'passport-google-oauth20' package is for authentication via Google
9) Dev dependencies installed are: nodemon, cross-env
10) The 'cross-env' package allows us to have a global/environment variable inside our start and dev scripts for our Node environment.
    This differs depending on your operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux)

11) The start script is what we'll be using in production and we set NODE_ENV=production
